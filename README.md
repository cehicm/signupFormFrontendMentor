# Frontend Mentor - Intro component with sign up form

View live: https://signup-form-frontend-mentor-iaa44mqco.vercel.app/

The goal:
Creating a fully responsive signup form, that warns users if the following input is incorrect:
  1. Password is too short.
  2. Password doesn't contain any numbers or capital letters.
  3. Incorrect email format.

The challenge:
  1. Taking the mobile-first approach, by initally designing the page for smaller devices before moving on to large screen design.
  2. Solving GitHub conflicts that come up along the way.
  3. Update the solution to be more accessible.
  4. Using grid.

What I learned:
  1. How to better write accessible code.
  2. How to use the grid to make writing responsive code easier. 
  3. Using PerfectPixel to see if what I'm doing matches the solution.
  
What I would(will) do differently:
  1. Remove @font-face.
  2. Double check where I am before commiting/pushing changes.
  3. Use a CSS preprocessor for optimization reasons -- better workflow and code.
